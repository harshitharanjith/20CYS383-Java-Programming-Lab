Declare two lists (say 'a' and 'b') containing elements, 1,2,3 and 4,5,6. Perform the following operations in sequence

(1) concatenation (call this list as 'c')

(2) print the concatenated list 3 times (call this list as 'd')

(3) slice the list 'a' from index 1 to 3.

(4) slice the list 'b' omitting first index and give the second index as 3.

(5) slice the list 'c' omitting second index and give the first index as 3.

(6) print the list 'c' from index 1 to 3.

(7) print the contents of list 'c' omitting both the indices


CODE:
a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]

c = a + b
print("c =",c)

print("d =",(c)*3)

print(a[1:4])
b[3].update
